# Console Package
## what is Console
“Console” in programming refers to an interactive interface that allows the user to communicate with the program. It can be used to input data, display results, or execute commands. Sometimes, a “Console” can be as simple as a command window or terminal in an operating system, where the user can type commands and see the results.

In the context of programming, a “Console” is often used to execute simple codes written by beginners, through which the user can practice and see the results of the code quickly. In addition, a “Console” can be used to execute applications that perform a specific task that does not require user interaction, or requires simple input.

It’s worth mentioning that a “Console” is not limited to simple programming only, but can be used to execute complex codes and has important outputs.
