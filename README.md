## Classes 🏛️
- **OpioEngine**: A class in the .net project that runs ops files. It previously ran ops files without translation, and this feature may return.
- **OpioMode**: A class that runs only one Mode.OPS and some of them compile from an op file.
- **OpioSimply**: It is the basic translator from op to ops.
- **OpioTask**: Some tools used for testing and some other things.
- **OpioSimplyAction, OpioAction, OpioClass**: Operating systems for testing.
- **OpioConsole**: To support Class Console in ops, op.
- **OpioTranslator**: Multilingual translator.

## Translation from op to ops 💽
The tool works by separating each command individually. It uses the OpioMode system to send the untranslated code, then performs the custom translation of every single thing after identifying it and builds an integrated code.


# OpEditor 🎙️
OpEditor is a unique programming editor designed for the Opio programming language. It supports both textual and visual programming, and includes a translator and an operator for the Opio language.

## Features

- **Textual and Visual Programming**: Write code in text format or manipulate program elements graphically.
- **Op to Ops Translation**: Translate code written in Op (standard mode) into Ops (simpler mode).
- **Extraction for All Systems**: Extract a complete project for an application on all systems.
- **EXE Support**: Currently, the editor only supports the creation of `.exe` files for Windows systems.
